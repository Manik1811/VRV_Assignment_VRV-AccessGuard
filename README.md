# VRV Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
Project Overview:

The VRV Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system is designed to provide secure and efficient management of user roles and permissions within the organization. The system ensures that only authorized users have access to the appropriate resources based on their roles, streamlining administrative processes and enhancing security across the organization. By leveraging a robust role-based structure, this system provides flexible access management tailored to the unique needs of the VRV company.

Key Features:

Role Management: Create, update, and delete roles with customized permissions, ensuring users are assigned the correct level of access based on their job responsibilities.
User Access Control: Grant and revoke access based on defined roles, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users.
Permissions Management: Define and manage permissions for each role, specifying the actions users are allowed to perform within the system.
Audit and Reporting: Maintain logs of role assignments, changes, and access events to track and review system activity for compliance and security audits.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface for administrators to manage roles, users, and permissions efficiently.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: React, Material-UI for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
Backend: Node.js, Express for handling API requests and managing role/permission data.
Database: MongoDB (or SQL-based database depending on your systemâ€™s requirements) to store user roles, permissions, and logs.
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication and session management.

Project Objectives:

Security: Ensuring that sensitive data and resources are protected and only accessible to users with the proper permissions.
Scalability: The system is designed to scale with growing teams and increasing user access complexity as VRV company expands.
Efficiency: Reducing administrative overhead by automating role assignments and access controls, allowing administrators to focus on other critical tasks.
Auditability: Enabling compliance with security policies and regulatory standards through detailed access logs and audit trails.
Conclusion: The VRV Role-Based Access Control system plays a crucial role in safeguarding the company's assets and information by enforcing strict access policies based on user roles. The system not only enhances security but also improves efficiency by automating role management and permissions assignment. With its scalable design and user-friendly interface, the RBAC system is equipped to meet the current and future needs of VRV company.













# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to start edit delete add or modify permissions users and roles in database using this command json-server --watch db.json --port 3001.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
